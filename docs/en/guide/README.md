# Introduction

Welcome to the ProjectE Plugin! This is an Equivalent Exchange plugin designed for Minecraft Spigot/Paper servers, inspired by the famous ProjectE mod.

## What is ProjectE?

ProjectE is a plugin based on the concept of equivalent exchange, introducing a core matter transmutation system. Players can break down items into Energy-Matter Covalence (EMC) units and use this EMC to create new items.

## Core Concepts

### EMC (Energy-Matter Covalence)

EMC is the core currency of the ProjectE system. Each item has its corresponding EMC value, which represents the "energy value" of that item.

- **Learning Items**: Players need to "learn" an item before they can create it in the Transmutation Table
- **Converting Items**: By consuming EMC, players can convert learned items to each other
- **Storing EMC**: Use tools like Klein Stars to store large amounts of EMC

### Transmutation Table

The Transmutation Table is one of the core devices of ProjectE. It allows players to:

- View learned items
- Create items using EMC
- Learn new items

### Energy Collector

Energy Collectors automatically collect energy from sunlight to charge Klein Stars. There are three tiers:

- **MK1**: Basic collector
- **MK2**: Intermediate collector
- **MK3**: Advanced collector
